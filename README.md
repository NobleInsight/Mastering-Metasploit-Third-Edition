# Mastering Metasploit - Third Edition
This is the code repository for [Mastering Metasploit - Third Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/mastering-metasploit-third-edition?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788990615), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
We start by reminding you about the basic functionalities of Metasploit and its use in the most traditional ways. You’ll get to know about the basics of programming Metasploit modules as a refresher and then dive into carrying out exploitation as well building and porting exploits of various kinds in Metasploit.

In the next section, you’ll develop the ability to perform testing on various services such as databases, Cloud environment, IoT, mobile, tablets, and similar more services. After this training, we jump into real-world sophisticated scenarios where performing penetration tests are a challenge. With real-life case studies, we take you on a journey through client-side attacks using Metasploit and various scripts built on the Metasploit framework.

By the end of the book, you will be trained specifically on time-saving techniques using Metasploit.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders.

#### To load all the modules automatically to metasploit:

    ./msfrun.sh


### Manual Method
#### To load all the core metasploit module (exploit, auxiliary, post):

msf > loadpath /root/Desktop/Mastering-Metasploit/modules/

Loaded 12 modules:

    2 auxiliarys

    3 posts

    7 exploits

### To load all the Meterpreter scripts:

Copy all modules from book_meterpreter_scripts to /usr/share/metasploit-framework/scripts/meterpreter




The code will look like the following:
```
irb(main):001:0> 2
=> 2
```

This book targets professional penetration testers, security engineers, and law enforcement analysts who possess a basic knowledge of Metasploit, wish to master the Metasploit framework, and want to develop exploit writing and module development skills. Further, it helps all those researchers who want to add their custom functionalities to Metasploit. The transition from the intermediate-cum-basic level to the expert level by the end is smooth. The book discusses Ruby programming and attack scripting using Cortana. Therefore, a little knowledge about these programming languages is required.
